This application is one designed to aid in the act of running a game of Shadowrun the RPG. One of the things that I found is that rolling large amounts of dice for lots of low level grunts really slowed down the game. This program will attempt to roll all of the dice not rolled by the players. It has an initiative tracker as well making combat a piece of cake.
